  <h1> Champions of Europe 2023 </h1>
  <p>The 2023 UEFA Champions League final was the final match of the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League, 
the 68th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organized by UEFA and the 31st season 
since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. It was played at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, 
Turkey, on 10 June 2023,[5] between English club Manchester City and Italian club Inter Milan, with the former winning 1–0 via a second-half goal 
by Rodri, who was named man of the match by UEFA. For Manchester City, this was their first-ever European Cup, and first European trophy since 1970. 
Having earlier won the Premier League and FA Cup titles, they achieved the continental treble, only the second time it had been achieved in English 
men's football history.[6][7] As winners, Manchester City earned the right to play against Sevilla, the winners of the 2022–23 UEFA Europa League, 
in the 2023 UEFA Super Cup, as well as qualifying for the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup, triumphing in both competitions. They also qualified for the 
2025 FIFA Club World Cup through UEFA's champions pathway (winners of the 2021–2024 Champions Leagues)</p>

  <h1> Premier League legacy of Manchester City </h1>
  <p> Manchester City have claimed five of the last six and made it three on the trot 
     in 2023 when they saw off Arsenal's superb title challenge. Once again, it is 
     clear to see what is being predicted here. City are going to win the league 
     again next season. Alas, a four-peat</p>
  
  <h1> MODERN LEGACY OF SUCCESS </h1>
  <img src="city1.jpg" alt="Treble Winners"> 
  <p> Both the Chairman and Club owner, His Highness Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed, 
    were present in Istanbul earlier this month to witness City’s 1-0 unforgettable 
    win over Inter in the 2013 UEFA Champions League final.</p>
 
  <p>It was a victory that not only clinched the Club’s first-ever European 
    Cup but one that also sealed the Treble following on from our Premier 
    League and FA Cup successes.</p>
 
  <p>The triumph at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium represented the 14th major 
    piece of silverware secured by City under the inspired leadership of the manager 
    Pep Guardiola, with City having won five of the past six Premier League titles.</p>

  
 

  <p>And looking forward, the Chairman was adamant that this season’s incredible 
  catalog of success had only intensified the Club’s desire and hunger to further 
  build on that proud record of achievement looking to the future.</p>
