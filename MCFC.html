  <h1> Champions of Europe 2023 </h1>
  <h2>The 2023 UEFA Champions League final was the final match of the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League, 
the 68th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA and the 31st season 
since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. It was played at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, 
Turkey, on 10 June 2023,[5] between English club Manchester City and Italian club Inter Milan, with the former winning 1–0 via a second-half goal 
by Rodri, who was named man of the match by UEFA. For Manchester City, this was their first-ever European Cup, and first European trophy since 1970. 
Having earlier won the Premier League and FA Cup titles, they achieved the continental treble, only the second time it had been achieved in English 
men's football history.[6][7] As winners, Manchester City earned the right to play against Sevilla, the winners of the 2022–23 UEFA Europa League, 
in the 2023 UEFA Super Cup, as well as qualifying for the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup, triumphing in both competitions. They also qualified for the 
2025 FIFA Club World Cup through UEFA's champions pathway (winners of the 2021–2024 Champions Leagues)</h2>
